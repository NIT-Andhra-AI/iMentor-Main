### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$
5. **Silicon Validation:** Use low-ESR ceramic MLCCs ($ESR < 5\text{ m}\Omega$) to prevent ESR-dominated ripple. $\blacksquare$

### 3. 🎯 Previous GATE Questions (Last 10 Years: 2015–2024) with Tolerances
#### 📌 GATE 2024 (EE - NAT, 2 Marks)
**Question:** A boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode has an input voltage of $12\text{ V}$ and an output voltage of $30\text{ V}$. If the switching frequency is $50\text{ kHz}$ and average output current is $2\text{ A}$, calculate the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple $\Delta I_L$ for $L = 100\ \mu\text{H}$ (in Amperes).
* **Step 1:** Output voltage ratio: $\frac{V_o}{V_s} = \frac{1}{1-D} \implies \frac{30}{12} = 2.5 \implies 1-D = 0.4 \implies D = 0.6$.
* **Step 2:** Inductor current ripple: $\Delta I_L = \frac{V_s D}{f_s L} = \frac{12 \times 0.6}{50 \times 10^3 \times 100 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{7.2}{5.0} = 1.44\text{ A}$.
* **Answer:** **1.44 A** (Tolerance: 1.40 to 1.48).

### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$
5. **Silicon Validation:** Use low-ESR ceramic MLCCs ($ESR < 5\text{ m}\Omega$) to prevent ESR-dominated ripple. $\blacksquare$

#### 📌 GATE 2024 (EE - NAT, 2 Marks)
**Question:** A boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode has an input voltage of $12\text{ V}$ and an output voltage of $30\text{ V}$. If the switching frequency is $50\text{ kHz}$ and average output current is $2\text{ A}$, calculate the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple $\Delta I_L$ for $L = 100\ \mu\text{H}$ (in Amperes).

* **Step 2:** Inductor current ripple: $\Delta I_L = \frac{V_s D}{f_s L} = \frac{12 \times 0.6}{50 \times 10^3 \times 100 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{7.2}{5.0} = 1.44\text{ A}$.

* **Answer:** **146.4 V** (Range: 145.0 to 148.0).

### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$

**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$

### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$
5. **Silicon Validation:** Use low-ESR ceramic MLCCs ($ESR < 5\text{ m}\Omega$) to prevent ESR-dominated ripple. $\blacksquare$

### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$
5. **Silicon Validation:** Use low-ESR ceramic MLCCs ($ESR < 5\text{ m}\Omega$) to prevent ESR-dominated ripple. $\blacksquare$

### 2. Worked Higher-Education Problem with Step-by-Step Analytical Proof
**Problem:** Design a synchronous buck converter operating at $f_s = 200\text{ kHz}$ from $V_{in} = 24\text{ V}$ to deliver $V_o = 5\text{ V}$ at $I_o = 10\text{ A}$. Calculate the minimum inductance $L_{min}$ to limit the peak-to-peak current ripple to $\Delta I_L \le 20\%$ of full load, and size the output capacitor $C_{min}$ to maintain voltage ripple below $\Delta V_o \le 1\%$.

*Analytical Solution Step-by-Step:*
1. **Duty Cycle:** $D = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{5}{24} = 0.2083$.
2. **Current Ripple Target:** $\Delta I_L = 0.20 \times 10\text{ A} = 2.0\text{ A}$.
3. **Inductance Calculation:**
   $$L = \frac{V_o(1 - D)}{\Delta I_L f_s} = \frac{5 \times (1 - 0.2083)}{2.0 \times 200 \times 10^3} = \frac{3.9585}{400 \times 10^3} = 9.896\ \mu\text{H} \approx \mathbf{10\ \mu\text{H}}.$$
4. **Capacitance Calculation:**
   $$C = \frac{\Delta I_L}{8 f_s \Delta V_o} = \frac{2.0}{8 \times 200\times 10^3 \times 0.05} = \frac{2.0}{80000} = 25\ \mu\text{F}.$$
5. **Silicon Validation:** Use low-ESR ceramic MLCCs ($ESR < 5\text{ m}\Omega$) to prevent ESR-dominated ripple. $\blacksquare$
